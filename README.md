# JavaScript Lab 3 - Exercises Project

This repository contains my **JavaScript Lab Project (Lab 3)**.  
The goal of this lab was given by our professor: we had to solve several exercises in JavaScript and send them as a report.  

âœ… Instead of sending simple code files like my colleagues, I chose to create a **mini website** where:  
- Each exercise is displayed in a structured page.  
- The results of the JavaScript code are directly shown in the browser.  
- I also practiced **HTML, CSS, and responsive web design** to make it more presentable.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Content
- **index.html** â†’ Homepage with links to each exercise.  
- **exercice1.html** â†’ Contains:

  - Time conversion (minutes, hours â†’ seconds).  
  - Triangle surface calculation.  
  - Reverse a string.  
  - Reverse an array.  
  - Find the maximum of three numbers.  
  - Remainder of division.  
  - Even or odd check.  
  - Represent a person (object formatting).  
- **exercice2.html** â†’ Validate if a number is between 1 and 10.  
- **exercice3.html** â†’ Random number guessing game with counter.  
- **main.js** â†’ JavaScript file with all the functions and logic.

## âœ… Conclusion
This project is more than just a lab report:  
I built a **mini educational website** to present my solutions in a clear and interactive way.  
It allowed me to **practice JavaScript logic**, **HTML & CSS structure**, and also **responsive web design**.
